The ZVZNF is a board which is a redesign in a similar vein to the Numato Mimas
V2 but customizes it for the HDMI2USB / LiteX purposes.

TODO: The primary changes between the Numato Mimas V2 are;
 * Having a Spartan 6 LX25
 * Having HDMI output rather than VGA.
 * Having JTAG connected to PIC.
 * FIXME: Support for both Digilent and Numato connector spacing. 

The board should be form-factor compatible with the Numato Mimas V2.
