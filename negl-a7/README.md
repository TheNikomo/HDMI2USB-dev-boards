The NEGL is a board which is a redesign in a similar vein to the Digilent Arty
A7 board V2 but customizes it for the HDMI2USB / LiteX purposes.

TODO: The board should be form-factor compatible with the Digilent Arty but
makes the following changes;

 * Maps the clock pins to good locations on the PMOD connectors.
 * Adds a SD Card.
 * Replaces the 100Mbit Ethernet with Gigabit Ethernet.
